### Motor Insurance (2020 - 2022)

#### 2020 – Stable, Slight Profitability

- Claims: Total claim amount stood at $757.5K with a claim frequency of 16.7%. Claim settlement was strong (CSR 90%) with no rejections (CRR 0%) and pending claims at 10%. Claim severity was moderate at $84.2K.

- Underwriting & Profitability: With GWP of $1.0M, the Loss Ratio (74.1%) and Expense Ratio (25.3%) kept the Combined Ratio just below 100% (99.3%). This allowed a small underwriting profit of $6.7K.

- Renewals & Customers: Renewal ratio at 80% (churn rate 20%) showed decent customer stickiness. Average policy tenure was 4.9 years, reflecting a stable customer base.
  
👉 2020 was a relatively balanced year: strong settlement efficiency, controlled losses, and a narrow underwriting profit.


#### 2021 – Entering Loss Territory

- Claims: Claims rose to $1.1M, with severity increasing to $138.8K, though claim frequency dipped slightly (15.6%). CSR weakened to 80%, while CRR rose to 10%, indicating worsening customer experience in claims.

- Underwriting & Profitability: With GWP of $1.5M, the Loss Ratio (75.1%) and Expense Ratio (25.5%) pushed the Combined Ratio above 100% (100.6%), resulting in an underwriting loss of $9.5K.

- Renewals & Customers: Renewal ratio slipped to 78.1%, churn rate increased to 21.9%, though average policy tenure edged up to 5.0 years.

👉 2021 was a turning point: higher claims severity, weaker settlement, and higher rejection rates led to Motor slipping into underwriting loss.


#### 2022 – Losses Deepen

- Claims: Total claims fell to $819K, but claim severity stayed high ($102.4K). Frequency held around 15.9%. CSR remained weak at 80% with CRR at 10%. Pending claims stayed at 10%.

- Underwriting & Profitability: With GWP of $1.1M, the Loss Ratio (76%) and Expense Ratio (26.2%) drove the Combined Ratio up to 102.2%, deepening underwriting losses to $23.9K.

- Renewals & Customers: Renewal ratio declined further to 76.2% (churn 23.8%), and average policy tenure dropped to 4.2 years, signaling declining customer loyalty.
  
👉 2022 confirmed the downward trend: underwriting losses worsened and renewals weakened despite a lower claim amount than 2021.


#### 3-Year Portfolio Story (Motor)

- Claims: Frequency remained stable (~16%), but severity spiked in 2021 and stayed high. CSR fell from 90% to 80%, while CRR increased from 0% to 10%, weakening customer trust.

- Underwriting: From a narrow profit in 2020, Motor slipped into losses in 2021 and 2022. Expense ratios crept upward, pushing combined ratios above 100%.

- Renewals: Renewal ratios slid from 80% → 78% → 76%, with churn rate worsening. Average policy tenure peaked in 2021 but dropped sharply in 2022.

👉 Motor started as a stable performer but is now under strain: rising severity, falling settlement quality, and worsening retention (renewal ratio) make it a weak segment needing corrective action.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Health Insurance (2020 - 2022)

#### 2020 – Weak Profitability, High Claims Pressure

- Claims: Total claim amount reached $1.0M with a high claim frequency of 25% and claim severity of $128K. CSR was only 80%, CRR stood at 10%, and pending claims were 10%. TAT compliance was 87.5%.

- Underwriting & Profitability: With GWP at $1.1M, the Loss Ratio (91.4%) plus Expense Ratio (22.3%) pushed the Combined Ratio to 113.7%, resulting in an underwriting loss of $153.3K.

- Renewals & Customers: Renewal ratio at 75% with churn at 25%. Average policy tenure was 5.9 years, decent but under pressure.
  
👉 2020 showed Health as a weak line, with high claims burden and underwriting losses despite moderate retention.


#### 2021 – Losses Deepen, Claims Burden Grows

- Claims: Claim amount increased to $1.2M, with claim frequency rising to 26%. CSR slipped further to 76.9%, CRR improved slightly to 7.7%, but pending claims increased to 15.4%. Claim severity was $123.6K. TAT compliance weakened to 80%.

- Underwriting & Profitability: With GWP of $1.3M, the Loss Ratio (92.1%) and Expense Ratio (22.6%) drove the Combined Ratio up to 114.7%, producing a larger loss of $197.6K.

- Renewals & Customers: Renewal ratio fell to 72%, churn rose to 28%. Average policy tenure lengthened to 7.8 years, showing some loyal long-term customers despite weak profitability.
  
👉 2021 reinforced Health’s status as a problem product: growing claims and worsening renewal rates deepened the underwriting loss.


#### 2022 – Continued Struggles, No Recovery

- Claims: Claims returned to $1.0M, but claim frequency rose to 26.7%. CSR slipped further to 75%, CRR ticked up to 8.3%, and pending claims rose to 16.7%. Claim severity moderated to $112.8K, but overall performance stayed weak. TAT compliance dropped to 77.8%.

- Underwriting & Profitability: With GWP of $1.1M, the Loss Ratio (93.4%) and Expense Ratio (23.2%) pushed the Combined Ratio to 116.6%, resulting in another underwriting loss of $179.9K.

- Renewals & Customers: Renewal ratio dropped to 68.9%, churn worsened to 31.1%. Average policy tenure shortened to 6.0 years, reflecting reduced loyalty.
  
👉 2022 confirmed Health as the weakest product line: persistently high claims, poor settlement efficiency, and deteriorating customer retention.


#### 3-Year Portfolio Story (Health)

- Claims: Health has consistently carried the highest claim frequency (25–27%) and high claim severity, pressuring loss ratios year after year. CSR fell steadily (80% → 76.9% → 75%), while pending claims and TAT compliance worsened.

- Underwriting: Combined Ratios remained well above 110%, ensuring continuous underwriting losses. Losses grew in 2021 before slightly easing in 2022, but profitability never recovered.

- Renewals: Retention deteriorated from 75% to below 70%, with churn rate worsening from 25% to 31%. Policy tenure peaked in 2021 but dropped sharply in 2022.
  
👉 Across three years, Health is clearly the insurer’s most problematic product: high claims frequency, weak claims handling efficiency, and worsening renewals make it unsustainable without corrective action.
