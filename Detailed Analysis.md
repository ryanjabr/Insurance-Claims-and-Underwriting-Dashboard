### Motor Insurance (2020 - 2022)

#### 2020 â€“ Stable, Slight Profitability

- Claims: Total claim amount stood at $757.5K with a claim frequency of 16.7%. Claim settlement was strong (CSR 90%) with no rejections (CRR 0%) and pending claims at 10%. Claim severity was moderate at $84.2K.

- Underwriting & Profitability: With GWP of $1.0M, the Loss Ratio (74.1%) and Expense Ratio (25.3%) kept the Combined Ratio just below 100% (99.3%). This allowed a small underwriting profit of $6.7K.

- Renewals & Customers: Renewal ratio at 80% (churn rate 20%) showed decent customer stickiness. Average policy tenure was 4.9 years, reflecting a stable customer base.
  
ðŸ‘‰ 2020 was a relatively balanced year: strong settlement efficiency, controlled losses, and a narrow underwriting profit.



#### 2021 â€“ Entering Loss Territory

- Claims: Claims rose to $1.1M, with severity increasing to $138.8K, though claim frequency dipped slightly (15.6%). CSR weakened to 80%, while CRR rose to 10%, indicating worsening customer experience in claims.

Underwriting & Profitability: With GWP of $1.5M, the Loss Ratio (75.1%) and Expense Ratio (25.5%) pushed the Combined Ratio above 100% (100.6%), resulting in an underwriting loss of $9.5K.

Renewals & Customers: Renewal ratio slipped to 78.1%, churn rate increased to 21.9%, though average policy tenure edged up to 5.0 years.

ðŸ‘‰ 2021 was a turning point: higher claims severity, weaker settlement, and higher rejection rates led to Motor slipping into underwriting loss.




#### 2022 â€“ Losses Deepen

- Claims: Total claims fell to $819K, but claim severity stayed high ($102.4K). Frequency held around 15.9%. CSR remained weak at 80% with CRR at 10%. Pending claims stayed at 10%.

- Underwriting & Profitability: With GWP of $1.1M, the Loss Ratio (76%) and Expense Ratio (26.2%) drove the Combined Ratio up to 102.2%, deepening underwriting losses to $23.9K.

- Renewals & Customers: Renewal ratio declined further to 76.2% (churn 23.8%), and average policy tenure dropped to 4.2 years, signaling declining customer loyalty.
  
ðŸ‘‰ 2022 confirmed the downward trend: underwriting losses worsened and renewals weakened despite a lower claim amount than 2021.
