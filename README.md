## Tools & Methods Used
- Power BI: Dashboard creation, KPI cards, DAX measures (YoY, ratios).
- Excel: Data preparation.
- DAX: To create metrics needed for insights such as loss ratio , hit ratio , expense ratio etc.

## Data Collection & Preparation

## Data Modeling (Power BI)
- Built a separate Date Table covering 01-01-2020 to 31-12-2022.
- Marked it as the official Date Table and established relationships with fact tables.

#### Relationships created:
- DateTable[Date] â†” Policies[Policy Start Date] (1-to-many).
- Customers[CustomerID] â†” Policies[CustomerID] (1-to-many).
- Policies[PolicyID] â†” Claims[PolicyID] (1-to-many).

## Insights & Storytelling

### Motor Insurance â€“ Slight Underwriting Loss
- Claims: Frequency remained stable (~16%), but severity spiked in 2021 and stayed high. CSR fell from 90% to 80%, while CRR increased from 0% to 10%, weakening customer trust.

- Underwriting: From a narrow profit in 2020, Motor slipped into losses in 2021 and 2022. Expense ratios crept upward, pushing combined ratios above 100%.

- Renewals: Renewal ratios slid from 80% â†’ 78% â†’ 76%, with churn rate worsening. Average policy tenure peaked in 2021 but dropped sharply in 2022.

ðŸ‘‰ Motor started as a stable performer but is now under strain: rising severity, falling settlement quality, and worsening retention (renewal ratio) make it a weak segment needing corrective action.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Health Insurance - Problem Product
- Claims: Health has consistently carried the highest claim frequency (25â€“27%) and high claim severity, pressuring loss ratios year after year. CSR fell steadily (80% â†’ 76.9% â†’ 75%), while pending claims and TAT compliance worsened.

- Underwriting: Combined Ratios remained well above 110%, ensuring continuous underwriting losses. Losses grew in 2021 before slightly easing in 2022, but profitability never recovered.

- Renewals: Retention deteriorated from 75% to below 70%, with churn rate increasing from 25% to 31%. Policy tenure peaked in 2021 but dropped sharply in 2022.
  
ðŸ‘‰ Across three years, Health is clearly the insurerâ€™s most problematic product: high claims frequency, weak claims handling efficiency, and worsening renewals make it unsustainable without corrective action.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Life Insurance - Best Performing Product
- Claims: Life consistently reported very low claim frequency (6.7% â†’ 6.1% â†’ 5.6%), offsetting rising claim severity. CSR improved steadily from 90% to 92.6%, while CRR fell from 5% to 3.7%. TAT compliance remained the best among products (94â€“96%).

- Underwriting: Across three years, Life maintained the strongest profitability with Combined Ratios of 70â€“73%, driven by controlled Loss and Expense Ratios. Profits grew from $3.7M to $7.7M.

- Renewals: Retention remained exceptional (93â€“95%), churn rate consistently low (5â€“7%), and average tenure stable at ~9 years.
  
ðŸ‘‰ Life is the insurerâ€™s strongest and most reliable product: profitable, efficient, and highly stable, providing the backbone of portfolio performance.
